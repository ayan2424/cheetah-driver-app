```text
Hello Codester Quality & Review Team,

Thank you for reviewing the Cheetah Driver & Warehouse Picker Mobile App (Flutter 3.x / Dart 3.x).

This is a production-grade, hand-crafted enterprise logistics client built from the ground up to accompany modern courier and WMS operations. It contains zero AI wrappers, zero license locks, zero domain restrictions, and zero obfuscation. All code is cleanly structured under reactive MVVM (GetX) with decoupled hardware services.

KEY PRODUCTION VALIDATION HIGHLIGHTS:
1. Static Analysis: Passed 'flutter analyze' with ZERO issues, ZERO warnings, and ZERO errors.
2. OS Compatibility: Validated on Android 14 & 15 (Target SDK 35, Min SDK 21) and iOS 18 (Xcode 16 / CocoaPods 1.15+).
3. Native Hardware Security:
   - Tokens stored in Android Keystore / Apple Keychain (AES-256 GCM via flutter_secure_storage).
   - Offline POD Queue uses Hive with AES-256 local encryption and automatic connectivity re-sync.
   - Low-level OS hardware listeners detect GPS disable tampering and alert dispatchers.
4. Testing Suite: Complete test scenarios documented in TESTING.md with unit tests in test/parcel_model_test.dart.
